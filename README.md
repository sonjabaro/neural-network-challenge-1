# neural-network-challenge-1
module 18
I uploaded a copy of the source file in colab to complete this exercise.  
As you'll see in the code I saved my files to my google drive in colab, and then upon completion I pushed to git hub using colab integration
which I established earlier when using colab.
The way I worked this challenge was to access the class recordings and activities, as well as return to the pdf of the slides for our classes, especial day 2 and day 3.
